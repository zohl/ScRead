<h1>ScRead (Anki plugin)</h1>

<p>ScRead (short for Scrutinized Reading) is a plugin for Anki SRS.</p>

<p>It is a set of tools to help you read texts in a foreign language. 
In a nutshell, it ensures that you know all words in a text before
you read it, and if not, it helps you to memorize them.</p>

<h2>Requirements</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://ankisrs.net/">Anki</a> — a spaced repetition flashcard program</li>
<li><a href="http://www.soimort.org/translate-shell/">trans</a> — Google Translate
CLI (optional)</li>
<li><a href="http://sdcv.sourceforge.net/">sdcv</a> — console version of StarDict
(optional)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<h3>Manual</h3>

<p>Copy <code>scread</code> folder and <code>scread_loader.py</code> to <code>addons</code> in your Anki's
home directory.</p>

<h3>Using ankiweb</h3>

<p>(!TODO not shared yet)</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<h3>Getting started</h3>

<p>Check menu for <code>Tools → ScRead</code> item. If this is your first time,
choose <code>Init</code>. The decks will appear.</p>

<h3>Basic flow</h3>

<p>This is a description of a typical cycle of using the plugin.</p>

<h5>Adding texts</h5>

<p>Choose subdeck <code>Texts</code> and add texts you would like to read. Make sure
that type of note is set to <code>ScRead.Text</code> (see top left corner on the
screenshot). There are two fields:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>Source</code> — source of the text, e.g. url of an article, a book's name,
a chapter's number of a book, etc.</li>
<li><code>Text</code> — the text by itself</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="./static/screen-text.png" alt="screen-text" title="" /></p>

<p>Then choose <code>ScRead → Texts…</code> menu. There are few options:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>parse all</code> — Will parse all texts you have added. This may take a lot of
time and result in enormous amount of cards, so use it wisely.</li>
<li><code>parse next one</code> — Will parse next one text you have added in chronological
order.</li>
<li><code>parse next shortest one</code> — Will parse next shortest one text you have
added. This is recommended option if you add unrelated texts.</li>
</ul>

<p>After that new cards will appear.</p>

<h5>Filtering words</h5>

<p>Go to subdeck <code>Words → Unsorted</code>. There will be all (new) extracted
words from your texts. For each card there you should choose either
<code>Again</code> or <code>Good</code>:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>Again</code> means this word is new for you and you would like to learn it.</li>
<li><code>Good</code> means this word is familiar to you, so you don't need it to be learned.</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that <code>Easy</code> button has no meaning, and each card will be checked only once.
You don't need to clear all deck at once, the filtering process (this)
and memorizing one (see the next paragraph) can be performed in parallel.</p>

<h5>Memorizing words</h5>

<p>Choose <code>ScRead → Words… → add translations</code> to supply new cards with
translations. There are few sources:</p>

<ul>
<li>Google Translate (via <code>trans</code> utility)</li>
<li>StarDict dictionaries (via <code>sdcv</code> utility)</li>
<li>Etymonline.com (works out-of-box) </li>
</ul>

<p>To avoid abusing web services there are delays between translations,
so this stage might be quite long.</p>

<p>After that new words will appear in <code>Words → Filtered</code> subdeck. It's a
typical memorizing deck, so you just learn words there.</p>

<p><img src="./static/screen-filtered-deck.png" alt="screen-filtered-deck" title="" /></p>

<h5>Reading texts</h5>

<p>Choose <code>ScRead → Texts… → update estimations</code>. This will determine which texts
you will able to read and place them in <code>Texts → Available</code>
subdeck. The rule of thumb is the most of new words must be in
<em>mature</em> state (see Anki's statistics).</p>

<h3>Special cases</h3>

<h5>Updating</h5>

<p>In order to update the plugin just replace it's files, restart Anki
and choose <code>ScRead → Init</code>.</p>

<h5>Clearing</h5>

<p>In order to clean up decks choose <code>ScRead → Reset</code>. This will erase
all data from Scread decks.</p>

<h5>Marking words</h5>

<p>There are two options in <code>Scread → Words…</code> menu:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>mark as known</code> — This is equivalent to choose <code>Good</code> for all cards in
<code>Words → Unsorted</code> subdeck. It's useful when you add easy texts to
mark all those words as well-known, so they won't bother you in the
future.</li>
<li><code>mark as unknown</code> — This is equivalent to choose <code>Again</code> for all cards
in <code>Words → Unsorted</code> subdeck. It's useful when you have read a lot
of texts, so it's unlikely to encounter a familiar word.</li>
</ul>

<h5>Scraping web-pages</h5>

<p>In case of big amount of web articles there may be taken a benefit of
scraping feature. To use it add new text with field <code>Source</code> filled
with a url and empty <code>Text</code> field. After that choose <code>ScRead → Text… → fetch</code>.
<code>Text</code> field will be filled with page contents and the note will be tagged as <code>fetched</code>.</p>

<p>Heuristic algorithm that extracts contents in the most cases does fine
with a portion of surfeit texts like comments and links to related
articles. That's why the note is tagged, so it should be checked and
edited if necessary.</p>

<p>That's not perfect but much better than manual copying from browser.</p>

<h5>Loading texts from files</h5>

<p>Like in the previous case texts can be loaded from local filesystem. The files
will be loaded "as is", without scraping procedure.</p>

<p>It's better to specify absolute path, like <code>C:\books\chapter1.txt</code> or
<code>~/books/chapter1.txt</code>.</p>

<h5>Batch loading/scraping</h5>

<p>In case of big amount of articles it may be tiresome to add note for
each url. This may be accomplished with <code>ScRead.Batch</code> notes. </p>

<p>Add a new note with <code>List</code> field filled with list of urls, each one on
a separate line. Both local and remote urls can be specified. In the
next invocation of <code>ScRead → Text… → fetch</code> corresponding notes will
be created and filled.</p>
